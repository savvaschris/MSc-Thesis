\begin{abstract}
Digital image matting refers to the area of computer vision that attempts to solve the problem of separating the foreground from the background and compositing it to and new background. Traditional image segmentation algorithms make a hard segmentation of multiple regions in an image, whereas in alpha matting fuzzy regions are taken into account as mixed regions and fractional values are estimated to form an alpha matte that is used for compositing. The standard method for matting used in the industry is blue screen matting, where the background is monochrome, usually green or blue. Recent research focuses on solving the problem of natural image matting, where the background consists of a variety of colours. Natural image matting is an ill-posed problem, where for a given image we have multiple solutions. The under constrained nature of the problem requires prior input, usually a user provided trimap or a set of scribbles. 
Bayesian matting was a first attempt to solve the matting problem, which uses a Bayesian framework, and another basic approach is Closed Form matting where the Colour Line Model is assumed to estimate alpha and the notation of a Matting Laplacian Matrix is introduced. Other methods include consideration of pixel affinities and image gradient, use of depth or texture information as priors, use of more sophisticated sampling methods, and the use of better classification algorithms. Matting has been extended to video, where trimaps are automatically generated and temporal coherence of alpha values is considered. Other research approaches consider the use of custom hardware to solve the matting problem. 
In this thesis I present the work done to develop a matting system that consists of a new matting algorithm and the extension of it to an application with the use of Microsoftâ€™s Kinect sensor. Execution times are promising for a real time application using GPU hardware. Future work consists of the use of the new Kinect 2 sensor and consideration of illumination sources in natural images to improve the matting and compositing method.

\acknowledgement 
I would first like to thank my fellow student Mr. George Georgakis that was involved in the early stages of the project that this thesis is based upon. His excellent knowledge in the areas of computer vision and image processing along with his exceptional analytical and programming skills were very helpful in development of many of the ideas during the experimental process. 
I would also like to thank lab assistant Mr. Ioannis Konstantinou, an expert in the areas of image/video processing and computer vision, that offered guidance and recommended many ideas. 
Last and most importantly I would like to thank my supervisor Dr. Yiorgos Chrysanthou for the initial motivation and conceptualization the whole project and his consultation during various phases of the research process.
